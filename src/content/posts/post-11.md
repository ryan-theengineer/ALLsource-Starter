Hello everyone! I hope you've been well. I'm sorry for the long delay between these blog posts, I've been working super hard this past month!

I've pivoted a bit from the CompTIA A+ and decided to go for the Google Cybersecurity Certification instead. Due to the specialization in Cybersecurity, the hands-on lectures and lessons, and the financial aid which was very easy to get! It seemed like a better choice as it would be hard for me to afford the CompTIA exam, but the Google Certificate is much more cost efficient.

So far I've done a good bit of the course! Completing the first part and 50% of the second! At the pace I'm going I hope to finish the course by the end of January. I know this certificate will level my skills up and give me a good opportunity to compete!

It has also taught me two amazing ways to stand out to recruiters such as a <span style="color:552A8B">[Dropbox Account](https://www.dropbox.com/home/Job%20Resources%20-%20Ryan%20S%20%281%29?share_manage_access=false&sharing_recipient_info=)</span> for storing important documents and professional resources. And by drafting a professional statement stating my skills, values, and goals in the industry. I also stored this on my Dropbox under the professional documents folder.

Finally, in the course I've completed a hands on research project, involving the analysis of a risk assessment and subsequent drafting of a written statement on how to improve security posture of an imaginary client. I've also stored this writeup and supporting material in my Dropbox <span style="color:552A8B">[Google Cybersecurity Folder](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/ff8apeu039ucv7lxppmd6/h?rlkey=gz4h0jebhewjxd18a43olwpq7&dl=0)</span>

As well as working on the certificate I have just updated strong-star with a portfolio entry based on the certificate, as well as new link in the footer of strong-star relating to Dropbox. I also did some work including this blog post, such as fixing typos, creating new CSS classes, and more! If you'd like to see the  code for the updates to strong-star please visit my GitHub, or view the changes in the source code.

Thank you for viewing and have a wonderful rest of your day!
