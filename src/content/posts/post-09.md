Good day everyone I hope you are well, trying to squeeze as much of my free time into Strong-Star as I can, I have updated the README file to be much more in depth and user friendly!

The original README file was a boilerplate written by the Astro.js developers, I feel as though Strong-Star is coming into its own and deserved it's own README file.

You can view the full list of changes and commits on GitHub to see what I've uploaded [README Commit](https://github.com/ryan-theengineer/strong-star-starter/commits/main).

If you'd like the tutorial project that I followed to get the basis of Strong-Star you can view it here: [Build your own!](https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorial/0-introduction/)

As well as a fully feature README I have left the original README file included in the tutorial project within the Public Folder of this project, you view it here: [Original README](https://github.com/ryan-theengineer/strong-star-starter/tree/main/public).

I wanna thank everyone for coming on this journey with me! I will continue to document my adventures and what I'm learning during this project and more!

Hope to see you here again soon!
