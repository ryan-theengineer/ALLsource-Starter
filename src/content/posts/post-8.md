Welcome back to the blog everyone, I hope your day is well. 

Just a quick update on project strong-star, I fixed an issue I was noticing that related to the social media footer and buttons. 
The design was unresponsive on smaller screens and didn't work well. I updated the CSS classes for the links to include a responsive flexbox, I also added a media query @800px. 

Finally I updated some CSS classes, as I felt they were a little confusing and/or misleading.

This resulted in a much better user experience where the content stacks on-top of each other, instead of the being pushed off screen on smaller devices.

I also improved the CSS for the buttons to include a better visual experience overall. If you'd like to view it please open project strong-star on your favorite mobile browser!

If you'd like to see the commits of what I've done, you can find it here and view the raw code if you have similar projects in mind!:

For some more excitement, I'm officially going to be taking the CompTia A+ Core 1 and 2 exam!

I've decided to take this step in my engineering journey due to the fact that I already hold a decent amount of knowledge relating to computer basics, and the A+ exam will certify that knowledge.

There are plenty of certifications available, but I've chosen this due to it's more general approach to computer knowledge.

Please wish me luck in my studies, and if anyone is interested in learning more about the CompTia A+, please get in contact and I'll share my research!

For now you can visit the CompTia A+ homepage, for more information:
