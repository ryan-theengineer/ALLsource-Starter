I hope everyone is well, I have been very busy in my personal life. I'm dedicating about 10-15 hours to my job search and still pushing!

I want to dedicate more time to this blog and my projects in order to maximize my outreach. I'm trying to determine what would be the best plan of action in doing so.

As of now, I'm still working through TryHackMe's course as well as doing plenty of research on Cybersecurity and related issues. I'm also experimenting with different Linux distributions.

I have a couple of blogs that might be interesting to people who want to know more about Cybersecurity, I'll post them below so you can see what I've been reading about!

Thank you for coming along with me on this journey, I hope you get some insight and if you have any feedback I would love to hear it!

Thanks for reading!

Good information about the workings of Metasploit, how to get started with it and some use cases. Includes a detailed tutorial for installing Metasploit on a Debian-Based Linux Distribution. Metasploit is a popular framework for Pentesters and Ethical Hackers. (Blog title is a little misleading.)
