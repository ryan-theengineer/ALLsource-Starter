<!-- Greetings everyone and welcome to another blog post. I hope the day is treating you well. 

I am currently riding out the storm here in Southern California, lots of rain today!

I've decided to start my bug tracking journey today, in this blog I will document my progress.

_________________________________________

I started by studying [This Blog](https://medium.com/bugbountywriteup/how-i-found-my-first-3-bugs-within-an-hour-5421c0aab8b8) on Medium, it gave me some helpful tools like SocialHunter, Amass, Subfinder and AssetFinder that I used to enumerate the USA.gov website in order to locate subdomains.

As described in the blog I started with these tools and gathered a list of subdomains that I could run in SocialHunter.

_________________________________________

I used some different tools like [HTTProbe](https://github.com/tomnomnom/httprobe) to find the domains that were running.  -->
