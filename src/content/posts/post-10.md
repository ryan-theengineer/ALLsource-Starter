Hello everyone I hope you're well, I'm going to do a few writeups of the new TryHackMe.com security engineering learning path which has just been released! I hope to learn a ton from it and maybe get some cool prizes along the way.

You can also join along and get the prizes with me, if you sign up for premium using my link we both get two tickets!

I have been using TryHackMe for about 3 months now and have gained a pretty fundamental understanding of Cybersecurity. This path is slightly different which I find very interesting. Hopefully it can bump me back into the top 2%!

I've done a preliminary glance into the learning path and there is a bunch of great information that teaches you the basics of what a Security Engineer does and the tools they use everyday.

I will have more blog posts to come as I follow along with the course and learn more. I'm eager to get started and see what they have in store! If you wanna join along you can follow this link: [TryHackMe Security Engineer Path](https://tryhackme.com/path/outline/security-engineer-training)

I hope to see you there and see what prizes you unlock along the way!

There are some prerequisites to taking the path TryHackMe recommends having a bit of knowledge about programming languages (just the basics, like what they are and what they do). You should take these into consideration, and make sure to ask for help if you find yourself getting stuck.

Other than that they recommend you clear your mindset and jump into get some prizes!

Application security has always intrigued me, and as someone with a Software Engineering background I think this is the perfect path for me!

I am very interested in learning Cryptography as well which is a very important aspect of Security Engineering.

As well as Cryptography and other various techniques it will also give the basics to hardening of software security and more!

Finally it will teach you threat modeling and risk management so you can understand exactly what is going on in your systems and how to protect yourself or your clients.

I'll attempt to go through the module and provide some feedback and useful tricks along the way as well as writeups for the labs if there are any problems.

I encourage everyone to fire up a blog and talk through the module as you do it, it will help you retain and understand the module a lot better!

I'm going to start doing the same with all of the rooms and labs that I complete very soon. It's a fun way to connect yourself to the content and become even more skilled.

They say the best way to learn is to teach others so, I hope this will begin mine (and yours!) journey towards mastery of the subject of security.
