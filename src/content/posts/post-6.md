Hello, it's been a minute since my last blog post. I hope everyone is well.

I have updated the project with new portfolio features since last time, as well as a TryHackMe link at the bottom of the page.

If you'd like to view any of the content in it's raw form you can visit the GitHub repository:

https://github.com/ryan-theengineer/strong-star-starter/

I would be happy to walk you through the blog if you're curious!

Hope to see you in the next update!
